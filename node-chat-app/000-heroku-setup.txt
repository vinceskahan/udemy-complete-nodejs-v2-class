Setting up for heroku
=====================
 - heroku is odd, you need a .git tree and package.json in the root of the project,
   making having one github repo for multiple projects problematic.
 - simplest way is to git init 'in' the project subdir and track it twice (ugly)
   meaning you need to take special care in your 'many project' parent tree .gitignore
 - you also have to commit twice and carefully:
     cd into the dir to commit to heroku
     but remember to cd .. to commit this (with other projects) to github

Heroku init steps are as follows

  # cd into the subdir containing package.json
  heroku create
  git add .
  git commit -am 'add heroku here'
  git push --set-upstream heroku master

  # open in a browser
  heroku open
